/** \class ProfilerApp
  *
  * This class provides some basic timing and profiling capabilities.
  * It works be providing start, stop, and save functions that allow the user to record 
  * the total time required for blocks of code.  The results are written to an ASCII data 
  * file that can be viewed directly or processed.  It is compatible with MPI and SAMRAI.
  * The overhead of the function is ~1us per call for start and stop.  the time for save 
  * depends of the amount of data to be written and the speed of the writes.  Additional 
  * details can be provided with set_store_trace which records the actual time (from startup)
  * for each start and stop call.  This method significantly increases the memory requirements.
  * Several preprocessor define statement are given for easy incorporation: \verbatim
  *    PROFILE_START(NAME) - Start profiling a block of code with the given name
  *                          The name must be unique to the file and there must be a corresponding stop statement.
  *    PROFILE_STOP(NAME)  - Stop profiling a block of code with the given name
  *                          The name must match the given start block, and there must only be one PROFILE_STOP for each 
  *                          PROFILE_START.  This records the current line number as the final line number for the block of code.
  *    PROFILE_STOP2(NAME) - Stop profiling a block of code with the given name
  *                          The name must match the given start block.  This is a special stop that does not use the current 
  *                          line as the final line of the block, but is provided for cases where there are multiple exit
  *                          paths for a given function or block of code.
  *    PROFILE_SAVE(FILE)  - Save the results of profiling to a file.   
  *    PROFILE_ENABLE(0)   - Enable the profiler with a default level of 0
  *    PROFILE_ENABLE(ln)  - Enable the profiler with the given level
  *    PROFILE_DISABLE()   - Disable the profiler
  *    PROFILE_ENABLE_TRACE()  - Enable the trace-level data 
  *    PROFILE_DISABLE_TRACE() - Disable the trace-level data 
  *    PROFILE_ENABLE_MEMORY()  - Enable tracing the memory usage over time
  *    PROFILE_DISABLE_MEMORY() - Disable tracing the memory usage over time
  * \endverbatim
  * Note that these commands are global and will create a global profiler.  It is possible
  * for a user to create multiple profilers and this should not create any problems, but the 
  * class interface should be used. <BR>
  * All start/stop and enable support an optional argument level that specifies the level of detail 
  * for the timers.  All timers with a number greater than the current level in the profiler will be ignored.
  * The macros PROFILE_START and PROFILE_STOP automatically check the level for performance and calling an
  * unused timer adds ~10ns per call. <BR>
  * For repeated calls the timer adds ~ 1us per call with without trace info, and ~1-10us per call with full trace info. 
  * Most of this overhead is not in the time returned by the timer.  The resolution is ~ 1us for a single timer call.
  * Note that when a timer is created the cost may be significantly higher, but this only occurs once per timer.  <BR>
  * Example usage:
  *    void my_function(void *arg) {
  *       PROFILE_START("my function");
  *       int k;
  *       for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
  *          PROFILE_START("sub call");
  *          // Do some work
  *          if ( special_case1 ) {
  *             PROFILE_STOP2("sub call");
  *             break;
  *          }
  *          if ( special_case2 ) {
  *             PROFILE_STOP2("sub call");
  *             PROFILE_STOP2("my function");
  *             return;
  *          }
  *          // Some more work
  *          PROFILE_STOP2("sub call");
  *       }
  *       PROFILE_STOP("my function");
  *    }
  *    // Some where at the end of the calculation
  *    PROFILE_SAVE("filename");

     *    appends "-x" to indicate the number of recursive calls of the given timer.

     *    Note: the scoped timer is generally lower performance that PROFILE_START and PROFILE_STOP.
